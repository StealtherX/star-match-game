# Star Match Game

## Introduction

A simple game where the player has to select the correct amount of stars within a time limit. Once the game starts, the player has to select one or more numbers on the right that sum up to the number of stars on the left. Then repeat until all numbers on the right have been used.

This project is based on the [React 17: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/) Pluralsight course created by Samer Buna but with a couple changes:

1. Uses Typescript
2. Written as a React SSR app

## Instructions

1. Run `npm install` to install everything needed
2. Run `npm run dev:server` to start the server
3. Run `npm run dev:bundler` to start webpack
4. Play the game at `localhost:4242` in your favorite browser
